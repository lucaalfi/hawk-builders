# New Project Team 1 - Hawk Builders 
---

## Project Overview:
Our task is to design and develop a website that reflects the professionalism and expertise of a house construction company.

**Key features to add:**
  - Video Background on Landing Page: To captivate visitors from the moment they arrive, we'll incorporate a dynamic video background on the landing page.
  - Informative Content: The website will provide comprehensive information relevant to a house construction company, including services offered, project portfolios, testimonials, and contact details.
  - Client Gallery Page: A separate gallery page will be created to showcase images posted by clients, offering a visual testament to our company's successful projects and satisfied customers.

**Notes:**
  - We have the current code for the company! 
	  - This website needs to be re-designed with new ideas, additions, new features, and addressing bug fixes.
	  - This needs to be converted to ReactJS, and then also, needs to use TailWindCSS.
	  - For controlling the information on the website (the backend) - such as controlling the images; use firebase.
	  - For now I've left the company's original files under the Hawk-Builders-Legacy folder, while we can start working with it there ideally we would move everything to the website to the Hawk-Builders-New folder as we convert it into ReactJS.
	  - I've tried get node to update as many modules as possible as many of them were deprecated. Be mindful that you may find new bugs that were not expected due to changes in behavior. 
	  - If you want to take a look into the legacy code just navigate to Hawk-Builders-Legacy, run 'npm install' and then run the app with 'npm run dev', it should start on localhost:3000.
- Hawk-Builders-New is the basic started project for React/Vite, this is a placeholder but it's just so we have a place to start. 

## An Addendum about Git: 
Everyone works with Git a bit differently but my suggestion would be that as we work on this project we should each make a new branch where our changes will live Those then should be merged into an active development branch one at a time before merging the cumulative changes in that branch into main. React is incredibly modular so it should help to minimize conflicts but keeping a well structured repo would also be helpful.
